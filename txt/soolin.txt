A native of Gauda Prime, Soolin's parents were farmers, killed when the Federation
declared Gauda Prime an open planet, suspending the rule of law so that the mining
corporations could ruthlessly move in to exploit newly discovered mineral deposits.
Soolin grew up learning the hard way to survive and eventually tracked down and
killed the men she held responsible for her parents' deaths. That done, she stayed
with Dorian on Xenon Until the arrival of Avon and the other Liberator survivors.
After Dorian unsuccessfully tried to kill them all, her included, she chose to stay
with them.

Soolin is a very cool, unemotional, perceptive and intelligent person.
She also has a sharp sense of humour. Possibly because of similarities in their
personalities, she seems to get on best with Avon. As a result of the events of her
childhood, Soolin is extremely quick on the draw and a deadly shot.
