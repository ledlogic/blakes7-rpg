Darla is the daughter of Hal Mellanby, a well-known rebel leader and predecessor of Blake.
When a revolt led by Mellanby failed, he fled with his infant daughter to Sarren, a remote
and primitive planet and hid there until Avon and Servalan crash landed there during the
Intergalactic War. Mellanby was killed by Servalan and Dayna left with Avon, swearing
vengeance against Servalan

Dayna is young, curious and impetuous. She also has a great fondness for combat and
weapons, especially the primitive hand-to-hand variety. That said,
she is also an expert both at designing advanced weapons and at demolitions.
