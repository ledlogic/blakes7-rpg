Cally is an Auronar, an alient telepath from the non-Federation world of Auron.
While Auron pursues an isolationist policy, Cally chose to join the fight against
the Federation and was exiled from Anton for it. She joined the rebels fighting
on Saurian Major and was the sole survivor when the Federation used chemical and
biological weapons against them, her alien physiology saving her. Cally their met
Blake, Vila and Avon who were attacking the Federation Communications centre on
Saurian Major. After destroying the base, Cally joined the crew of the Liberator. 

Cally is tough and compassionate. She often acts as the conscience of the crew,
despite being the only alien aboard the Liberator. Her telepathy enables her to
"speak" with the rest of the crew but she is unable to read their thoughts.
Cally's telepathy also leaves her feeling alone, without the company of fellow
telepaths.
