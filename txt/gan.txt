Olag Gan is a native of the Federation world of Zephron. He was convicted of
the murder of the Federation trooper who killed his woman. As an experiment,
Gan was fitted with a limiter implant in his brain. The limiter enables him
to defend himself, up to a point, but prevents him from killing again. Gan
was then sentenced to deportation to Cygnus Alpha, from which he was rescued
by Blake and the Liberator. Gan is big, strong, courageous and quiet, but
not afraid to Speak out when he feels it necessary. Although, by his own
admission, not too bright, he is strong on common sense.
