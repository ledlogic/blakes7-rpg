Although a privileged Alpha grade citizen, Roj Blake rebelled against the oppressive
society of the Federation which maintained order by drugging its citizens and by
brutal repression. Blake founded the Freedom Party, in underground dissident movement
but was captured by Federation security. Rather than execute him and provide the
dissident movement with a martyr, the Federation brainwashed Blake into recanting his
principles, put him on show as a model reformed citizen and then erased his memory.
When the dissidents attempted to reverse the Memory erasure and bring him back into
the movement, the Federation had him falsely convicted on charges of child molesting
and sentenced to transportation to Cygnus Alpha. En route to Cygnus Alpha he escapes,
along with Avon and Jenna, by boarding and seizing control Of the Liberator. Blake is
a passionate and charismatic idealist who seeks to destroy the tyranny of the Terran
Federation. He is perhaps headstrong and prone to act emotionally, without thinking
things through property. Blake is, however, above all, highly moral.
