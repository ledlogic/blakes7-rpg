Jenne Stannis is a pilot and a very good one. She began her career as a smuggler
with a group of Amagons, unscrupulous space-going nomads, driven almost exclusively
by the pursuit of wealth. Jenna built up a very good reputation as a smuggler but
was eventually caught. The Federation deported her to the penal colony of Cygnus
Alpha. En route to Cygnus Alpha she escapes, along with Blake and Avon, by boarding
and seizing control of the Liberator.

Jenna maintains a sardonic and realistic attitude. She is somewhat attracted to
Blake and his ideals but still retains her worldly viewpoint.
