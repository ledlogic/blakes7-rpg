A brilliant computer expert, Kerr Avon turned his talents to crime and nearly pulled Off the greatest swindle
in Federation history, attempting to defraud the Federation banking cartel of several million Credits. Avon was,
however, caught and sentenced to deportation to the Federation penal colony of Cygnus Alpha. En route to Cygnus
Alpha, he escaped along with Blake and Jenna, by boarding and seizing control of the Liberator.
Avon is outwardly cold, supremely emotionless and logical; always looking out for his own self-interest.
He often takes issue with Blake's idealism and motives, and yet continues to stand by him.
