Vila Restal is a Delta grade, one of the labour grades that make up the lowest order
of Federation society. A compulsive thief from childhood with a genius for lockpicking,
long spells in detention and extensive mental conditioning all failed to cure him of
his urge to steal anything and everything and be was finally sentenced to deportation
to Cygnus Alpha, from where he was rescued by Blake aboard the Liberator. Vila is a
complex character. He constantly plays the fool and coward, but is clearly highly
intelligent and perceptive.
