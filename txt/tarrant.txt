Tarrant started out as a Federation pilot before deserting and taking to smuggling
and gun-running. In the company of a band of Federation troopers, he came across the
temporarily abandoned Liberator at the end of the Intergalactic War and then joined
the crew of liberator, having first killed most of the troopers himself. Tarrant then
took over as pilot from the now missing Jenna.

Tarrant is still and headstrong. To begin with, he seemed in constant conflict with
Avon over who commanded Liberator, a conflict Avon eventually won. He is, however, an
excellent pilot, with a good deal of inside knowledge of Federation tactics.
